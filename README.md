# Project: Operationalizing Machine Learning

I have configured a cloud-based machine learning production model, deployed it, and used it in this end-to-end machine learning project on Microsoft Azure. I trained a machine learning model on the Bank Marketing Dataset using the AutoML feature of Azure Machine Learning Studio, deployed it into production using Azure Container Instance (ACI), and used REST APIs to consume it. Additionally, I created, released, and consumed a pipeline to fully automate the procedure.



## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Future Work

- Using a parallel run phase in the pipeline will help this project. 
- Testing a downloaded model in a local container. 
- Automating the entire workflow, from data preparation to machine learning jobs and deployment
- Using pipelines establishing a benchmark for ideal performance using the Apache Benchmark tool.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
